"description": "The Starlight Foundation sought a working prototype that would engage sick kids in hospital. Often these kids are in and out of hospital, this prototype would be essential in making hospital visits a better experience. This prototype utilises a reimagined Stethoscope, a device that is common in hospitals giving control to children over their experience. As you place the Magic Stethoscope on objects, they would come to life through audio. The Magic Stethoscope allows kids to hear characters, listen to stories and create music around the Starlight Express Room. Using a colour sensor, colours were translated into audio and the whole room became a playground,",
