"description": "The Starlight Foundation briefed a working prototype that would engage sick kids in hospital. Often these kids are in and out of hospital, so it was essential that this prototype would make this experience a little better. This made way to look at the Stethoscope, a device that is common in hospitals. THe children were given agency through a prototype of the Magic Stethoscope. It allowed kids to hear characters, listen to stories and create music around the Starlight Express Room. As you place the stethoscope on and moved the breast plate over objects, they would come to life. Using a colour sensor, colours were translated into audio. There were two modes, story and music mode. The whole room became a playground",
