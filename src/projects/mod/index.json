  "description": "Winning a Distinction in the Digital Category in the 2019 AGDA Awards, the task was to concept and build an installation that enticed users to exercise through reward. A double sided FlipDot Tower prompted users to move around in MOD's Hedonism Exhibition. A visualisation on the FlipDot tower reflected how much ground users covered through the Lidar Sensor data. As users completed different levels they were rewarded with an animation that was pleasing to watch and hear through the clacking of the analogue flipdots.",
